        HOW TO USE
        data-players is the server ip, data-size is the css size of the images. Just put null as the value to use other css sizing.
        All images of heads have the css class "playerhead"
        A piece of text saying "Server Offline" will appear when the server is down. You can style it as it has the css class "offline"
        IMPORTANT: due to how mcsrvstatus works, you cannot use proxy backed servers (bungeecord, waterfall, velocity) only direct servers -->
        <div data-players="server.com" data-size="10%"></div>
